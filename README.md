## Features

* Docker running (only supports Linux/OpenWrt platforms)
* Supports AppleTV pairing
* Supports automatic app refresh
* Supports use of multiple Apple ID accounts
* I18n support

## Installation

> 😔 **Only supports Linux/OpenWrt systems, does not support Mac/Windows systems.**

1. The Linux/OpenWrt host needs to install `avahi-deamon`.
   
   OpenWrt：
   ```
   opkg install avahi-dbus-daemon
   /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon start
   ```
   
   Ubuntu；
   ```
   sudo apt-get -y install avahi-daemon
   sudo systemctl restart avahi-daemon
   ```

2. Please refer to the following command for installation, remember to modify the mount directory.
   
   ```
   docker run --privileged -d --name=atvloadly --restart=always -p 5533:80 -v /path/to/mount/dir:/data -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus -v /var/run/avahi-daemon:/var/run/avahi-daemon bitxeno/atvloadly:latest
   ```

   The `/var/run/dbus` and `/var/run/avahi-daemon` of the host machine need to be shared with the docker container for use.



## Getting Started

### Preparation (very important‼️)

1. A burned account
> Dedicated Apple ID installation account, both free or developer accounts are acceptable (**For security reasons, avoid using commonly used accounts. Instead, create a burned account for installation!**)
2. A phone to 2FA Verification
> atvloadly needs to be authorized as a trusted device (it will be virtualized as a MacBook). During the installation process, Apple will send a 2FA code either to your phone number associated with installation account or trusted device where you're logged into your installation account. (**failure to verify the authorization verification code within timeout will result in temporary account freeze! Password reset is required for recovery**)

### Operation process

1. Open the Apple TV settings menu, select `Remote and Devices -> Remote App and Devices`, enter pairing mode.
2. Open the web management page, normally it will display the pairable `AppleTV`.
3. Click on the `AppleTV` device to enter the pairing page and complete the pairing operation.
4. After successful pairing, return to the home page, where the connected `AppleTV` will be displayed.
5. Click on the connected `AppleTV` to enter the sideload installation page, select the IPA file that needs to be sideloaded, and click `Install`.

## FAQ

1. How many apps can be installed with a free account?

> Each free Apple ID can register up to 10 apps and activate up to 3 apps simultaneously. Installing more than 3 will cause previously installed apps to become unavailable.

2. Installation failure after system upgrade.

> After upgrading the system, re-pairing is required. Generally, newly released systems are not supported. It is recommended to disable automatic system updates.

3. Can App-specific passwords be used for passwords? Is it more secure this way?

> Currently does not support it.
